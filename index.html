    <h2>About Climate Action</h2>
    <p>Climate Action focuses on the urgent need to address the global crisis caused by rising temperatures, pollution, and environmental destruction. It’s not just about understanding the problem — it’s about taking concrete steps to reduce emissions, restore ecosystems, and promote sustainable living for all life on Earth.</p>
    <p>Forests, rivers, and oceans are natural allies in our fight against climate change. They absorb carbon dioxide, regulate weather, and support biodiversity. Through collective awareness and community-driven projects, climate action empowers individuals to create real, measurable impact on our planet’s recovery.</p>

    <h2>Causes Behind the Crisis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Millions of trees are cut down each year, releasing stored carbon and destroying habitats.</li>
      <li><strong>Industrial Emissions:</strong> Factories, vehicles, and power plants emit harmful gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.</li>
      <li><strong>Unsustainable Consumption:</strong> Overproduction and wasteful habits increase pollution and resource depletion.</li>
      <li><strong>Fossil Fuel Dependence:</strong> Reliance on coal, oil, and gas continues to accelerate global warming.</li>
      <li><strong>Neglect of Nature:</strong> Urban expansion and plastic pollution are suffocating our planet’s natural systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Taking Action for a Greener Future</h2>
    <p>Climate action starts with awareness — and grows through change. Simple daily habits like conserving energy, reducing plastic use, and supporting sustainable brands contribute to a global movement toward sustainability.</p>
    <p>Plant trees, join local clean-up drives, and support renewable energy. Encourage policies that protect natural resources and hold industries accountable for emissions. Together, we can turn advocacy into action and restore the balance of our planet for generations to come.</p>
